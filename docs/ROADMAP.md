## Phase 9 --- Pending Submissions and Deterministic Block Assembly

**COMPLETE for the authorized Windows Release/x64 integration proof
(2026-09-09).** The separate `stn-chain-phase9-test.exe` uses the same
executable runtime, STNC dispatcher, validators, candidate construction,
real SHA-256/PoW, and NTFS storage, with explicitly scripted identity
hooks. This is not production signature/authority qualification; the
production executable remains fail-closed.

The 1,544 executable integration checks prove RPC admission and
canonical IDs, pending accounting, concurrent duplicates/status, ordered
multi-item candidates, stable work, invalid/stale work rejection,
nonce-only solutions above 32 bits, acceptance and exact cleanup, clean
restart/content reconstruction, and continued submissions through height
65 with reconstructed work at height 66. The existing 1,130,094 C checks
(including peer adoption, unrelated-entry preservation, failure
atomicity and catch-up/reorg regressions) and 34 build probes also pass.
No Phase 10 work was started.

Reorg re-addition, pending persistence/gossip, production identity
providers, Stratum integration and other future phases remain deferred.
The broader milestones below retain their original evidence
requirements.

## Phase 10 --- STN-Chain ↔ STN-Stratum Integration

**Chunk 1 COMPLETE on Windows Release/x64 (2026-09-09).** Actual current
C:`\poes`{=tex}\_projects`\stn`{=tex}-stratum server/client sources are
qualified for configured STNC connection, INFO, mining-template
retrieval, solved-work request/result contract,
stale/unavailable/errors, reconnect, and concurrent Chain RPC. 81
cross-process integration checks, 27 Stratum parser checks, two existing
session assertions, all 1,130,094 Chain C checks and 34 probes pass.

The work corrected Stratum-side bounds, missing INFO, response-shape
validation, send/receive timeouts and unsafe mutation retry; Chain
wire/consensus semantics are unchanged. The independent driver links the
same client and Windows transport used by the running Stratum server.
External miners, jobs/shares and Chunk 2 are not qualified or started
here. Production identity remains fail-closed.

**Phase 10 Chunk 2 COMPLETE (Windows Release/x64, 2026-09-09).** The
actual Stratum server maps real Chain 0x2002 templates to deterministic
STNM jobs with exact candidate/work ID/target/nonce preservation,
session-independent bytes, replacement on changed work and no
fabricated/cached current jobs when unavailable. 93 new observation-only
checks pass; 81 Chunk 1 checks, 27 Stratum parser checks, two session
assertions, 1,130,094 Chain C checks and 34 build probes remain passing.
No production mapping defect was found. Accepted test content uses the
authorized scripted-identity Chain runtime. No miner execution/shares or
Chunk 3 work occurred.

**Phase 10 Chunk 3 COMPLETE (Windows Release/x64, 2026-09-09).** Actual
STNM miner-result messages traverse the current Stratum server and STNC
0x2003 to Chain acceptance/rejection. 115 new checks prove exact
candidate/target/work ID, full-width nonce, malformed/unknown/replaced
job rejection, bounded session isolation/reconnect and accepted pending
cleanup/restart. Two Stratum protocol handling defects were minimally
repaired; Chain consensus remains unchanged. Prior Chunk 1/2, Phase 9
lifecycle, C suites and build probes pass. The result generator and
identity hooks are explicit test fixtures, not production miner or
identity qualification. Chunk 4 was not started.

**Phase 10 Chunk 4 COMPLETE (Windows Release/x64, 2026-09-09).** 148
actual- process failure-state checks qualify Chain loss/recovery,
submission during outage, empty-work reconnect, exact same-work
restoration, changed work across miner disconnect, stale results,
partial-frame disposal, session isolation and Stratum restart. One
Stratum defect was repaired: failed submission now invalidates cached
current work immediately instead of waiting for polling. Chain consensus
is unchanged. Prior Phase 9 and Phase 10 suites pass. Hardware-miner
qualification, discovery, durable queues and Chunk 5 remain out of
scope.

## Phase 10 --- Chain ↔ Stratum Integration COMPLETE

Qualified on Windows Release/x64 (2026-09-09). Chain-issued work passes
through actual STNC 0x2002, deterministic STNM jobs, fixture miner
results and Stratum's STNC 0x2003 submission into independent Chain
validation and persistence. Work identity, full target and canonical
candidate remain exact except the permitted 64-bit nonce. Invalid/stale
results remain rejected; bounded sessions agree.

The final 125-check lifecycle stops Chain and Stratum once, recovers
identical accepted INFO and block bytes with Stratum absent, then starts
a fresh coordinator. Unavailable work yields no placeholder/cached
current job. New height-two work extends the recovered accepted tip with
a new Chain work ID. Stratum coordinates mining; STN Chain remains
consensus authority. No production fix was necessary.

All 562 Phase 10 process checks (81/93/115/148/125), 1,544 Phase 9
checks, 1,130,094 Chain C checks, 27 parser checks, two session
assertions and 34 build probes pass. Release/x64 builds have zero
warnings/errors. Identity and result fixtures remain test-only;
hardware, production identity, accounting, performance and other
platforms are not qualified. Phase 11 has not started.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stage 2 is isolated development work. Any temporary block-production
harness is explicitly non-consensus and does not qualify for public
operation. Contract design can proceed alongside consensus design;
general-purpose execution requirements must be resolved before freezing
the contract engine.

GPU and compatible ASIC work follows algorithm and work-interface
decisions. Coin-market integration is outside the core implementation
milestones.

## First end-to-end exercise

Use synthetic intelligence and test identities. Submit a signed report
via an API adapter or explicitly labeled adapter test fixture, validate
it on node A, persist it, synchronize it to node B, and deliver it to a
test consumer shaped for future Sentinel_Daemon integration.

Demonstrate tamper rejection, duplicate handling, interrupted
persistence, restart, and a consumer reconnecting after missing records.
A fixture is not evidence of completed integration with the actual
STN-Labz API.

## Working discipline

Update docs/CHANGELOG.md with each meaningful change. Keep protocol
decisions and implementation status accurate. Run checks suited to each
increment; documentation-only changes require link and diff checks, not
invented runtime tests. Do not treat prototypes as evidence of
production readiness.

## Phase 11 --- Deterministic Difficulty Adjustment --- COMPLETE

Windows Release/x64, 2026-09-10. The following chunk checkpoints are
historical; the final Chunk 4 qualification below completes this phase.

**Chunk 1 COMPLETE: calculation foundation only (2026-09-09).** The
owner supplied 60-second spacing, 60-block windows, boundary height 60,
accepted H-60/H-1 endpoints, 3600-second expectation, 900/14400-second
clamps, floor arithmetic and existing target limits. See POW.md for the
exact API, arithmetic and bootstrap rules. 193 targeted checks qualify
canonical deterministic next-target calculation; 1,130,287 Chain C
checks and 34 probes pass. Phase 9 (1,544) and all Phase 10 (562)
process checks remain passing. Release/x64 builds have zero
warnings/errors. Normal acceptance and templates still use the qualified
fixed target. Dynamic adjustment is not operational. Chunk 2 has not
started. \### Phase 11 Chunk 2 --- COMPLETE (Windows Release/x64,
2026-09-09)

Required-target consensus is activated. Validation and mining share one
branch-derived rule; target equality remains separate from real SHA-256
PoW. Adjusted state reconstructs from canonical persistence,
branch-specific reorgs retain ordinary cumulative-work preference, and
the actual Stratum path preserves the changed target through
acceptance/restart. See POW.md for exact rules and limits. 1,658 new C
checks and 834 adjusted-target process checks pass; total Chain C checks
are 1,131,945. Prior Phase 9 (1,544), Phase 10 (562), and 34 probes
pass. Builds have zero warnings/errors. Phase 11 as a whole is not
marked complete; later qualification remains outside this increment.
Chunk 3 has not started. \### Phase 11 Chunk 3 --- COMPLETE (Windows
Release/x64, 2026-09-10)

The authorized 320-bit cumulative-work representation preserves the full
target and height domains. STNC/STNP v2 transport 40-byte work without
truncation; canonical block storage reconstructs it without a format
change. Legacy fixed-target development evidence receives strict
current-rule validation. See POW.md for the exact mathematical bound and
qualification scope. Chunk 4 has not started; Phase 11 as a whole
remains open. Evidence: 223 new C checks; 1,132,168 total C checks, 34
probes, 1,544 Phase 9, 562 Phase 10 and 834 adjusted-target process
checks, 27 Stratum parser checks and two session assertions. Zero
warnings/errors/failures. No Chunk 4 work.

## Phase 11 Chunk 4 --- final convergence qualification COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Deterministic difficulty adjustment is qualified on Windows Release/x64.
Required targets follow validated branch ancestry through validation,
mining, STNC/Stratum, actual P2P, reorganization and reconstruction.
Cumulative work remains exact unsigned 320-bit / 40-byte canonical
big-endian. Consensus, protocol layouts and the strict legacy-history
boundary are unchanged.

The existing C peer harness adds 1,109 checks with two independent
NTFS-backed node states and actual loopback Winsock exchange. Both start
at shared genesis. One bounded partition permits independent 60-block
branches: 1,800/7,200-second ancestry spans derive harder/easier targets
at height 60. Both nodes validate received evidence independently and
converge on the greater-work branch. One node replaces 60 blocks from
the common genesis through existing atomic storage adoption. A
wrong-target block satisfying its encoded-target PoW, accompanied by a
fabricated maximum advertised work value, is rejected with accepted
state and stored bytes unchanged.

Both node states are discarded and reconstructed by reopening canonical
stores; all 61 block byte sequences, tips, current targets, 40-byte work
and next targets agree. Fresh STNC mining work uses the converged
target; the pre-reorg job is stale. A separate scripted block-hash
fixture repeats exchange/reconstruction above the former 256-bit work
limit. The ordinary scenario uses real SHA-256. Node-state
teardown/reload is in-process; the existing 834-check adjusted-target
process lifecycle additionally stops/restarts Chain and Stratum and
proves continued mining. This does not add automatic P2P process
orchestration.

Final evidence: 1,133,277 Chain C checks, 34 build probes, 1,544 Phase 9
checks, 562 Phase 10 checks, 834 adjusted-target process checks, 27
Stratum parser checks and two session assertions. Windows Release/x64:
zero warnings/errors/failures. No production defect or production-code
change was required in Chunk 4. Production identities, hardware,
Internet operation, performance and other platforms remain unqualified.
Phase 12 was not started. No commit or push.

## Phase 12 --- Automatic P2P Orchestration

### Block 1 --- deterministic peer candidate foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The existing peer core now provides a bounded 64-entry IPv4/port
candidate set, canonical endpoint identity and deterministic sorted
enumeration. Malformed endpoints, duplicates and full capacity have
explicit outcomes without eviction or unrelated mutation. This is local
resource/selection policy, not consensus. See PEER_PROTOCOL.md for the
API, eligibility rules and platform boundary.

440 targeted checks pass; total Chain C checks: 1,133,717. Also passing:
34 build probes, 1,544 Phase 9, 562 Phase 10, 834 adjusted-target
process checks, 27 Stratum parser checks and two session assertions.
Windows Release/x64 production, test and scripted-runtime builds: zero
warnings/errors/failures. No prior production defect required
correction; existing consensus and transport behavior is unchanged.

Phase 12 remains open. Automatic connections, retries, reconnect,
failover and discovery await later authorization. No other-platform
qualification. Block 2 was not started. This increment was not committed
or pushed. \### Block 2 --- automatic outbound connection management
COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Repeated configured IPv4 peers feed the qualified candidate set. A
portable, monotonic-paced outbound lane selects deterministically,
reuses existing P2P handshake/synchronization, retains usable sessions
and closes/advances after failure. The Windows executable composes it
with private scratch and existing RPC/pending exclusion. Candidate
preference never confers consensus authority.

Passed 165 new C checks (121 policy + 44 real Winsock), 30 executable
checks, 1,133,882 total Chain C checks, 34 probes, 1,544 Phase 9, 562
Phase 10 and 834 adjusted-target process checks. Windows Release/x64
builds: zero warnings, errors and failures. Block 1's 440 checks remain
passing. No existing production defect required correction; session
reuse and bounded outbound I/O are additions. See PEER_PROTOCOL.md and
BUILD.md for runtime limits and qualification scope.

Phase 12 remains open. Discovery and later authorized orchestration work
remain. Block 3 was not started. This increment was not committed or
pushed.

### Block 3 --- peer discovery COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Established peers may advertise a bounded list of configured IPv4
candidates via STNP v2 capability bit 2 and one `GET_PEERS`/`PEERS`
exchange. The 386-byte maximum payload carries at most 64 fixed-width
endpoints. Receivers validate the complete batch through the Block 1
store, omit configured self endpoints, and commit only after
deterministic sorting and capacity checks succeed. The existing Block 2
manager then uses admitted candidates; no second store or connection
path exists.

Passed 974 new C checks (955 codec/policy and 19 real Winsock failover),
40 executable discovery checks, and 30 outbound/27 pending executable
regressions. The resulting 1,134,856 Chain C checks, 34 build probes and
prior Phase 9/10/11 process suites passed with zero failures on Windows
Release/x64. Discovery does not alter accepted state, storage, pending
state or consensus. No external bootstrap, gossip, scoring, reputation,
banning or other platform qualification.

Phase 12 remains open. Block 4 was not started. This increment was not
committed or pushed.

### Block 4 --- portable orchestration boundary qualification COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest prerequisite is the cross-platform boundary required
before further orchestration: portable candidate, discovery and
outbound-policy values remain ISO C data with caller-supplied monotonic
time, while socket, thread and operation-deadline behavior stays behind
the existing platform adapter. Added portability checks round-trip
candidates and discovery payloads without OS types or native structure
serialization and verify the five-second policy constant.

The affected architecture review found no new Windows coupling in
`includes/` or `src/`; Windows-only behavior remains in
`platforms/windows/`. The existing Windows Release/x64 qualification
remains the only execution qualification. Seven targeted portability
checks pass; total Chain C checks are 1,134,863. Block 1--3 behavior,
consensus isolation, inbound/RPC/pending safety and clean shutdown
remain unchanged. Block 5 was not started; Phase 13 was not started.
This increment was not committed or pushed.

## Phase 12 --- Automatic P2P Orchestration --- COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Final integration qualification confirms Blocks 1--4 operate together
through the existing real Winsock/STNP paths. A bounded configured
candidate set connects deterministically, a peer supplies additional
candidates through one bounded discovery exchange, the candidates enter
the same sorted 64-entry store, and the existing outbound manager uses a
discovered endpoint after the original peer is lost. Existing
synchronization independently validates all evidence; malformed
discovery and invalid peer evidence leave accepted state, canonical
storage, pending state and RPC operation unchanged. Shutdown joins the
outbound worker and closes its resources; restart remains the supported
configured `--peer IPv4:PORT` startup model.

Final Windows Release/x64 evidence: 1,134,863 Chain C checks, 34 build
probes, 1,544 Phase 9 checks, 562 Phase 10 checks, 834 Phase 11 process
checks, 1,586 Phase 12 focused C checks across Blocks 1--4, 70 focused
executable checks, and 27 pending-RPC executable checks plus 29 Stratum
parser/session checks. All passed with zero failures; builds completed
with zero warnings and errors. No external bootstrap, gossip, scoring,
reputation, banning, or other platform backend was introduced.

Phase 12 is COMPLETE for bounded Windows Release/x64 qualification.
Phase 13 was not started. No commit or push was performed.

## Phase 13 --- RPC Production Hardening --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED

### Block 1 --- RPC framing preflight baseline COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The smallest unresolved hardening requirement was making the runnable
RPC stream reader use one portable fixed-header payload-bound check
before reading untrusted payload bytes. `stn_rpc_payload_length`
requires the exact 24-byte header and rejects declared payloads above
`STN_RPC_MAX_PAYLOAD`; existing magic, version, opcode, shape,
capability and response semantics remain in `stn_rpc_dispatch`. The
Windows application now uses this preflight in both persistent-client
and single-session loops. No protocol layout or consensus behavior
changed.

Three new RPC checks cover valid, truncated and over-bound declarations.
The complete C suite totals 1,134,866 checks with zero failures; Phase 9
(1,544), Phase 10 (562), Phase 11 adjusted-target (834), Stratum (29)
and build probes (34) remain passing. The legacy general node script's
fixed-target mining loop still stops at the authorized Phase 11
height-60 target transition; it is not used as a qualification claim.
Windows Release/x64 is clean.

Phase 13 remains active. Block 2 and Phase 14 were not started. This
increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 2 --- bounded incomplete-frame session handling COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next prerequisite-consistent boundary was the receive path after
Block 1 payload preflight: a partial header or payload could otherwise
remain in a Windows RPC session indefinitely because short-read polling
had no per-frame deadline. RPC header, payload and response transfers
now carry the existing 60-second bounded operation deadline. A timeout,
disconnect, reset or receive failure terminates that session, releases
its private buffers and closes its socket; completed frames and repeated
requests retain their existing behavior. No global parser state or
connection ceiling was added.

The framing-only executable qualification covers a split healthy request
during an independent incomplete frame, incomplete-header disconnect,
and deadline termination: 19 checks, zero failures. The portable RPC
parser and Block 1 preflight remain unchanged; the deadline is Windows
transport plumbing only. Windows Release/x64 remains clean. Block 3 and
Phase 14 were not started. This increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 3 --- complete-frame session continuity and response association COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest unresolved boundary was qualification of repeated
complete frames within an established RPC session. The existing bounded
receive loops consume exactly one header and payload, dispatch it,
complete its response transfer, and only then begin the next request;
request and response buffers remain private to each client. Focused
runtime coverage verifies back-to-back requests with distinct request
identifiers, response association, an incomplete-header disconnect, the
Block 2 deadline, and continued operation of an independent client: 22
checks, zero failures.

No wire, parser, dispatch, consensus or authority behavior changed.
Block 1 preflight and Block 2 deadlines remain intact. Windows
Release/x64 remains clean. Block 4 and Phase 14 were not started. This
increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 4 --- deterministic protocol error behavior COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest unresolved boundary was protocol-visible error/status
qualification for complete but unsupported or malformed requests.
Existing portable dispatch behavior now has focused runtime coverage for
deterministic unsupported-method and malformed-shape responses,
request-ID association where the request decodes, valid-request
continuation, and isolation from transport failure. The combined framing
qualification is 33 checks with zero failures. No status codes, wire
fields, consensus, authority, or transport semantics changed. Block 5
and Phase 14 were not started. This increment was not committed or
pushed.

### Block 5 --- RPC lifecycle churn and failure reclamation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest unresolved boundary was deterministic session
reclamation under connection churn. Existing per-client ownership and
joined cleanup were qualified with 153 executable checks covering twelve
disconnects before a first request, twelve request/teardown/reconnect
cycles, request-ID association, and a healthy session kept active
throughout. No stale parser, response, socket, or accepted-state data
crossed a connection boundary. Block 6 and Phase 14 were not started.
This increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 6 --- deterministic RPC shutdown and active-session release COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest unresolved boundary was shutdown ordering. The Windows
node now closes the listening socket immediately after entering the
stopping state, then joins outbound work and interrupts/reclaims active
RPC workers. The LifecycleOnly qualification preserves a healthy session
during churn and the full C suite remains passing. Block 7 and Phase 14
were not started. This increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 7 --- sustained concurrent RPC resource-bound qualification COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The next smallest unresolved boundary was bounded per-session ownership
under sustained concurrent clients. Existing host-resource-scaled
acceptance was qualified with 64 simultaneous clients issuing two
complete requests each, followed by cleanup and a healthy-session
request: 1,037 executable checks, zero failures. No protocol client
ceiling or eviction policy was added. Block 8 and Phase 14 were not
started. This increment was not committed or pushed.

### Block 8 --- final RPC integration qualification and closeout COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Blocks 1--7 compose through the existing Windows RPC runtime without
contradiction: framing preflight, bounded deadlines, complete-frame
continuity, deterministic protocol errors, churn/reconnect,
listener-first shutdown, and host-resource-scaled concurrency all remain
isolated and bounded. Final focused qualification passed framing (33),
lifecycle (153), concurrency (1,037), and pending-RPC (27) executable
checks; the full Chain C suite passed with 1,134,866 checks and zero
failures. Phase 9/10/11, Phase 12, Stratum, and portability evidence
remain passing. No unresolved Phase 13 RPC requirement was identified.
This closeout was not committed or pushed.

## Phase 13 --- RPC Production Hardening --- COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Phase 13 is complete for the qualified Windows Release/x64 environment.
The next authorized phase is **Phase 14 --- Production Identity /
Signatures / Authority**. No Phase 14 implementation was started, and no
other platform or production-security qualification is claimed.

## Phase 14 --- Production Identity / Signatures / Authority --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED

### Block 1 --- Production identity and signature foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

O-003 is authorized for Phase 14 Block 1. The production foundation uses
the canonical 32-byte Ed25519 public key as identity, a fixed
domain-prefixed signing statement, strict 64-byte PureEd25519
signatures, deterministic verification results, and fail-closed
malformed/invalid handling. Signature validity remains separate from
authority. The isolated public-domain provider is qualified only on
Windows Release/x64; Block 2 was not started.

### Block 2 --- deterministic authority evaluation foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Authority evaluation now consumes the Block 1 canonical identity and
exact versioned action/context tokens. Canonical evidence is bounded and
scoped to subject, action, and context. Evaluation is deterministic and
returns AUTHORIZED, UNAUTHORIZED, or MALFORMED; absent authority is
unauthorized and malformed or unsupported evidence fails closed.
Signature validity does not confer authority. No organizational policy,
contract lifecycle, wire change, storage authority database, or Block 3
work was introduced.

### Block 3 --- authority evidence provenance and grant validation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

The applicable genesis definition now supplies a bounded, sorted
public-key root set through the chain context. Only listed roots may
issue the dedicated `ISSUE_AUTHORITY_GRANT` capability. Canonical
194-byte grants sign exactly one Block 2 evidence record under
`STN-CHAIN:AUTHORITY:GRANT:1`; signature validity and issuer root
authority are evaluated separately. Only VALID_GRANT evidence can feed
Block 2. Recursive delegation and key lifecycle remain undefined. Block
4 was not started.

### Block 4 --- deterministic authority-grant revocation foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-10)

Canonical grants now have 32-byte SHA-256 identifiers. A fixed 129-byte
revocation record uses a dedicated signing domain and is valid only when
signed by the original genesis-root issuer of the referenced grant.
Valid revocations produce monotonic revocation state; duplicate
application is idempotent, and active authority evaluation rejects
revoked grants. State is reconstructed from accepted history rather than
a local blacklist. Block 5 was not started.

### Block 5 --- deterministic identity/key rotation foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-11)

The portable identity lifecycle now supports a fixed 129-byte signed
rotation from the currently active identity to one replacement. Accepted
lineage is monotonic and resolves sequential rotations
deterministically; duplicate edges are idempotent while conflicting
successors and cycles fail closed. Genesis-root succession is rejected,
authority grants do not migrate implicitly, and historical signatures
remain tied to historical identities. Block 6 was not started.

### Block 6 --- deterministic signed-action replay protection foundation COMPLETE (2026-09-11)

Replay protection reuses the existing signer-plus-record-nonce rule. The
fixed 64-byte replay identity is deterministic and portable; state
consumption is explicitly caller-controlled after accepted-state
publication. Fresh, replay, and malformed results are distinct, and
state reconstruction follows accepted history rather than pending
contents or a local cache. Grant, revocation, and rotation semantics
remain intact. Block 7 was not started.

### Block 7 --- accepted-history identity and authority lifecycle integration COMPLETE (2026-09-11)

Activated transaction types 2--4 for the qualified grant, revocation,
and rotation payloads. Added deterministic lifecycle replay-nonce
derivation and a portable accepted-history state reconstructor. Pending
evidence remains non-authoritative, rejected history does not consume
replay state, and branch reconstruction follows existing fork choice and
transaction order. Type 5 remains reserved and rejected.

### Block 8 --- production lifecycle state integration COMPLETE (2026-09-11)

The lifecycle state is now owned by Chain state during candidate
validation. The configured Genesis Initial Identity Set is canonical,
sorted, duplicate-free, limited to 16 exact 32-byte identities, and
separate from the Genesis Authority Root Set. Lifecycle-bearing
candidates are applied to temporary cloned state and published only
after the complete block passes semantic lifecycle validation.
Persistence, fork-choice replacement, reorganization, restart
reconstruction, and peer candidate validation therefore follow accepted
history. No Block 9 or Phase 15 work was started.

## Phase 15 --- Production Record / Intelligence Integration --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED

**COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-13).** Final review after checkpoint
`5ec7970` establishes the minimum signed/authorized record → STNC
submission → validated pending → accepted history → lookup/FIRST/NEXT →
Cursor v1 → reorganization diagnosis → deterministic recovery-plan
boundary. Blocks 1--4 are COMPLETE / QUALIFIED.

Completion does not include detached-history persistence, automatic
consumer rollback/replay, consumer databases, application-specific
schemas, Threat API or Sentinel integration, filtering, pagination, P2P
record queries, production credential provisioning, storage evolution,
contracts, economics or additional platform qualification. Existing
ownership/resource qualification limits remain.

### Block 1 --- canonical record foundation COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-12)

The existing publication transaction and STNR class 1 now use the
approved stable record identifier and corrected versioned publication
authority tokens. The genesis-lineage activation map in DECISIONS.md
preserves qualified unsigned development prefixes and activates
fail-closed Phase 14 signature, scoped authority, revocation, rotation
and replay validation. The optional development validation pointer is
not a production consensus switch.

Candidate-local publication transitions, pending isolation/revalidation,
accepted history reconstruction, branch replacement and
source-independent validation are implemented. The 610 targeted C checks
are included in the 1,135,591 full C checks; see BUILD.md for process
qualification and platform limits. Class 1 remains the existing bounded
development payload, not the future Sentinel data model. Windows
Release/x64 finishes with zero warnings, errors and failures. The
additional process/Stratum suites pass 5,215 checks; build probes pass
34.

No Block 2, additional record class, external artifact fetch, record
index/API, contract, economics, production credential provisioning or
Stratum interface work is introduced. Existing lifecycle snapshot
ownership outside rejected-candidate cleanup is not redesigned or
qualified for unbounded-duration operation here.

### Block 2 --- accepted production-record query COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-12)

STNC `GET_ACCEPTED_RECORD = 0x0004` provides the bounded 32-byte
record-ID lookup. FOUND returns the earliest eligible accepted witness
with canonical block height, block ID and exact publication transaction.
Existing status codes cover absence, malformed requests and local
unavailable/error/capacity outcomes.

The lookup reuses Block 1 production validation at each historical
transaction position. Private historical and observational replay
projections implement the Operations decision for pre-activation
evidence without changing legacy acceptance or allowing later grants to
authorize earlier records. Pending is excluded and untouched. No cache,
index or persistence format was introduced.

Qualification: 354 targeted C checks plus 40 executable/TCP query
checks; 1,135,945 full C checks, 5,255 process/Stratum checks and 34
build probes: **1,141,234 total checks, zero failures**. Windows
Release/x64 builds have zero warnings/errors. Stratum interface impact
is NONE. Block 3 was not started. Filtering, pagination, application
schemas, production credential provisioning, P2P query methods and Phase
16 storage/lifecycle ownership evolution remain outside this block. No
commit or push is performed by this increment.

### Block 3 --- Consumer Query / Cursor Foundation COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-13)

Qualified stn_chain_lookup_record(), stn_chain_first_record() and
stn_chain_next_record() own deterministic accepted-history lookup and
traversal. Pending state is excluded. Cursor v1 is exactly 45 bytes:
version\[1\]=0x01, accepted height\[8\] BE, block ID\[32\], transaction
position\[4\] BE. STNC 0x0004 GET_ACCEPTED_RECORD, 0x0005
GET_FIRST_ACCEPTED_RECORD and 0x0006 GET_NEXT_ACCEPTED_RECORD expose
that boundary. Historical eligibility, restart and branch-sensitive
reorganization behavior are qualified; detailed evidence remains in
CHANGELOG.md.

### Block 4 --- consumer reorganization semantics COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-13)

4A--4D qualify stn_chain_resolve_cursor_reorg() and
stn_chain_build_consumer_recovery_plan(), reporting common-ancestor
resolution and observational rollback/resume plans, and STNC
0x0007/0x0008. Integrated recovery feeds the actual returned cursor into
NEXT (or invokes FIRST for FROM_START), including independent
connections. Current/unknown/malformed results, exact Chain/STNC
equivalence, retained-evidence reconstruction, greater-work
reorganization and existing 0x0004--0x0006 regressions pass.
Accepted-only persistence still does not retain detached branches.

Windows Release/x64: 1,408 targeted consumer checks (including 261 TCP
assertions), 40 executable/TCP checks, 34 build probes: **1,482 total**,
zero failures, warnings or errors. TCP assertions are included in the
targeted count. No full Chain suite or additional platform qualification
was performed. No production repair was required in 4D. Existing
long-duration lifecycle ownership limitations are unchanged.
Mining/Stratum interfaces and STNC frame version remain unchanged. No
commit/push or subsequent block started.

Final Phase 15 closeout supersedes the earlier provisional non-closure
statement. Consumer recovery is deterministic when the required
validated historical evidence is retained. When available validated
evidence cannot establish ancestry, recovery fails closed as
unavailable; mandatory detached-history persistence was not introduced.
Frame version and mining interfaces are unchanged. Stratum impact: NONE.
Stratum requalification: NOT REQUIRED.

## Phase 16 --- Storage Records / Storage Evolution --- COMPLETE

**Historical qualified micro-chunk checkpoint: `8a1264a`.**

Operations reports the Storage Records scope complete and development advanced
into Phase 17 (2026-09-21). The existing 1A-1C qualification evidence below is
preserved; this status update does not invent additional test results or claim
STNS v2, streaming, indexing, pruning or another storage redesign.

### Micro-Chunk 1A --- reconstructed lifecycle snapshot ownership and reclamation --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-14)

Explicit local lifecycle ownership is established across independently
surviving states. Create/clone owns, share retains, move transfers,
final release reclaims, and plain structure copies are borrows. Active
replacement, failed candidates, storage views, query temporaries,
fork/reorganization plans and peer reports release ownership correctly.

Repeated reconstruction/load/release and restart behavior passed.
Lifetime counters returned to baseline; survivor and repeated-release
assertions passed. No sanitizer qualification is claimed. Accepted-state
results, authority/replay behavior, record eligibility, STNS v1 bytes
and STNC behavior remain unchanged.

Qualification evidence recorded for 1A: **7,025 total checks** across
Chain ownership, lifecycle/query/recovery, publication/reorganization,
fork planning, storage/reconstruction, peer ownership/recovery,
executable/restart/STNC and build probes, with zero reported failures.

Mining impact: NONE. Stratum impact: NONE.

### Micro-Chunk 1B --- reconstruction lifecycle copy reduction --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED (2026-09-14)

Accepted-history reconstruction now reuses exclusively owned lifecycle
storage when capacity permits while preserving independent candidate
snapshots and the qualified 1A ownership model. Qualification
demonstrated reduction from **23 to 2 full lifecycle clones across a
23-block history**.

Allocation failures and partial semantic failures release temporary
state without invalidating surviving owners. Restart/reconstruction,
accepted tip, height, cumulative work, authority, revocation, rotation,
replay and production-record eligibility remain equivalent. STNS v1 and
STNC are unchanged.

Qualification: **7,866 targeted C checks**, **40 executable/restart
checks** and **34 build probes**: **7,940 total**, zero failures.
Windows Release/x64 completed with zero warnings and zero errors.

Mining impact: NONE. Stratum impact: NONE. Stratum requalification: NOT
REQUIRED.

Checkpoint containing qualified Micro-Chunks 1A--1B: **`249e643`**.

### Micro-Chunk 1C --- storage reconstruction span ownership --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED

Checkpoint: **8a1264a**.

Explicit reconstruction span ownership, lifetime and reclamation are
established. Source ownership is cleared on transfer; release clears
the table pointer/count. Empty-prefix recovery immediately frees its
unused table. Failure cleanup and qualified 1A/1B behavior are preserved.

Windows Release/x64: **0 warnings, 0 errors**. All **34 build probes**
passed. The existing storage test passed **2,751 checks, 0 failures**.

STNS/STNC/consensus/mining/Stratum interfaces are unchanged.
Stratum requalification: **NOT REQUIRED**.

Phase 16 is **COMPLETE** for the Storage Records scope reported by Operations.
Micro-Chunks 1A through 1C retain their recorded qualification. STNS v1 remains
the storage format; future storage redesign is not implied by this closeout.

## Phase 17 --- Additional Platform Qualification --- COMPLETE / QUALIFIED

Operations reports the following deployment results on 2026-09-21:

- Linux Chain operation is underway; Chain builds blocks and supplies mining work.
- Third-party external applications have demonstrated Chain API interoperability.
  Authoritative Chain data is publicly displayed on the stn-chain.org explorer.
- Linux Stratum operates as the miner endpoint. Miners connect and receive work;
  current operational mining uses CPU hardware.
- The empty-block/work-delivery issue is resolved after the recent Chain fixes.
- GPU, USB-ASIC and ASIC platform execution has not yet been tested.

These are Operations-reported results, not newly executed agent qualification.
No hardware benchmark, hashrate, additional platform pass count, or Phase 20
production qualification is inferred. ARM and other unreported targets retain
no new qualification claim. Existing Windows evidence remains scoped to its
recorded checkpoints. Operations has closed Phase 17 as COMPLETE / QUALIFIED
for the demonstrated operational scope.

GPU, USB-ASIC and ASIC participation/testing is external follow-up work. Results
will be recorded when operators provide them; their absence does not block
development, reopen Phase 17, or postpone its completion. Untested hardware is
not represented as tested or qualified. Phase 20 retains its separate scope.

## Phase 18 --- Contract Engine --- ACTIVE

Chunk 1 (Address Foundation) is COMPLETE / QUALIFIED on Windows and Linux:
portable typed identity (`stn0_`),
contract (`stnc0_`) and wallet-namespace (`stnw0_`) derivation, full text codec,
structural validation, 32-byte identifier access and display-only abbreviation.
Windows Release/x64 passes 5,057 focused checks and 34 platform/boundary probes.
Operations supplied Linux qualification on 2026-09-21: `make test-address` and a
subsequent `./test-address` run each passed 5,057 checks with zero failures. Both
platforms pass the same fixed vectors. ARM remains untested; Phase 18 as a whole
remains ACTIVE. See [Addresses](ADDRESSES.md).

### Phase 18 Address/STNC integration increment — IMPLEMENTED / QUALIFICATION PENDING

The qualified Chunk 1 native address foundation is now exposed through STNC v2
method `0x0009 DERIVE_ADDRESS` as a READ-only application interface. The request
carries an address type, exact source length and exact source bytes. The current
RPC operation accepts only `STN_ADDRESS_IDENTITY` and returns the canonical full
69-byte `stn0_` text generated by the existing Chain address implementation.

The RPC layer does not independently derive, hash or canonicalize the source and
does not expose `stnc0_` contract or `stnw0_` wallet-namespace generation.
Address derivation is independent of accepted-history snapshot reconstruction
and does not mutate consensus, persistence, pending or mining state.

Implementation is recorded separately from qualification. No new STNC address
integration test count, Windows/Linux runtime qualification or public
`stn-chain.org` module interoperability result is claimed by this documentation
update. The existing Chunk 1 Windows/Linux native-address qualification remains
the current evidence baseline.

Contract state machines and contract storage have not started. The established
design remains addressed agreements with deterministic participants, fields,
authority, sequence, signatures and state transitions. Wallet behavior and all
economics remain Phase 19. This component does not change existing Chain behavior.

No VM, EVM, arbitrary bytecode, arbitrary scripts or gas is authorized.

## Phase 19 --- Economics / Issuance / Rewards --- NOT STARTED

Production economics have not started. Native-coin issuance, rewards,
accounting and related economic rules remain deferred until explicit
Operations/consensus decisions authorize exact behavior.

No economic rule is inferred from mining participation, hardware class
or wealth, and no gas model is authorized.

## Phase 20 --- Production Qualification --- NOT STARTED

Final production qualification has not started. Completion will require
the applicable deterministic, negative, boundary, persistence, recovery,
interoperability, concurrency, protocol and platform evidence for the
production system then in scope.

Earlier Windows Release/x64 phase qualification is evidence for those
qualified increments; it is not by itself a Phase 20
production-readiness claim.
